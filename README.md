# IGGI 2.0 documentation for hospital IT departments.

## Access to the IGGI Service

The **IGGI 2.0 Antibiotica.app** provides healthcare professionals with access to antibiotic guidelines.  
Access to the service is controlled by the hospital’s IP addresses, which must be configured in the IGGI settings.

1. Ensure you have provided the support team with the hospital’s external IP address (or addresses).  
2. Test access to the service by visiting: [https://adult.be.antibiotica.app/](https://adult.be.antibiotica.app/)  
3. To simplify access for medical personnel, create a desktop shortcut to the service on workstations used by hospital staff. Refer to the attached icon files.
